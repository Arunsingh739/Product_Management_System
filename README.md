# Product_Management_System
Project Title: Product Management System
Technologies: Java, Collection Framework, JDBC, MySQL
Description:
•	Built a Java-based Product Management System to facilitate seamless CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for various product categories.
•	Designed and implemented a scalable architecture integrating backend business logic with a relational database for efficient data storage and retrieval.
•	Enhanced user experience by adding features like advanced search, sorting, and input validation.
•	Implemented dynamic search and sorting mechanisms for enhanced usability, allowing users to filter products by attributes such as price, category, or name.


1. Purpose
"This project is a Product Management System designed for managing an inventory of products. The primary goal was to allow users to add, retrieve, update, and delete products across multiple categories while ensuring data integrity and efficient performance."
2. Technology Stack
"I developed the application using Java as the programming language, JDBC for database connectivity, and MySQL as the backend database. The modular approach ensures that new features can be added without disrupting the core functionality."
3. Highlighting Core Features
•	CRUD Operations:
"The core of the system allows users to perform CRUD operations. Each operation is tightly integrated with the database using JDBC to ensure real-time updates."
•	Search and Sorting:
"I implemented dynamic search and sorting mechanisms for enhanced usability, allowing users to filter products by attributes such as price, category, or name."
•	Validation and Error Handling:
"I added validations for user input to prevent invalid data and implemented robust exception handling to ensure the system's stability."
4. Key Learning Outcomes
"This project deepened my understanding of core Java concepts such OOP concepts, Collection Framework, JDBC, structured exception handling, and writing modular code. It also gave me practical experience in designing and optimizing relational databases."
5. Future Enhancements
"In the future, I plan to enhance this system by integrating REST APIs to make it accessible for web or mobile applications. I also aim to add authentication features to control access based on user roles."
